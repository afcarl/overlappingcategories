# versatiletrainer.py
#
# Based on logisticpredict, which was based on (!)
# logisticleave1out.py which was based on (!!)
# parallel_crossvalidate.py from the paceofchange repo.
#
# The goal of the module is to construct predictive
# models of corpus *subsets*, in a very flexible way.
# This is necessary because my literary-historical
# interest in modeling is very rarely just
# "model everything and see what we get." I usually
# want to model chronological subsets, or experiment
# with different definitions of classes, or apply a
# model trained on subset A to subset B.
#
# Three problems in particular have to be solved:
#
# a) multilabel modeling
#
# I'm likely to have a corpus where each text bears
# several different class tags. The groups of texts
# identified by class tags will often overlap, and this
# can make it tricky to define positive and negative classes
# for a given modeling pass. Our goal is to ensure
# that no volumes with a positive tag are present in
# the negative class. At the same time,
#
# b) balancing distributions across time
#
# It is vital to ensure that the positive and negative
# classes have similar distributions across
# the timeline. Otherwise you will *definitely* get
# a model that is partly a model of language change.
# Other metadata categories (nationality and gender)
# might also need to be balanced across the positive
# and negative classes, if/when possible.
#
# finally, c) holding out authors
#
# If you just treat volumes as individuals and select a
# test set as a random sample, information about authors can
# leak from test into training, and give you unrealistically
# high accuracy. (You're learning to recognize Radcliffe, not
# learning to recognize the Gothic.) To avoid this, we make sure
# that groups of volumes by the same author are always in the same
# "fold" of crossvalidation.
#
# (Note that the success of this strategy depends on a previous
# fuzzy-matching pass across the corpus to make sure that authors
# have precisely the same name in every row, without extra initials
# or commas, etc).
#
# Much of the work I've just described is handled by
# the function get_data_for_model(), in this module, and inside
# the module *metafilter*, which it calls.
#
# Because we want to be very versatile, there are unfortunately
# a lot of arguments for get_data_for_model(). We pass in three tuples,
# each of which unpacks into a bunch of arguments.
#
# paths unpacks into
# sourcefolder, extension, metadatapath, outputpath, vocabpath
# where
# sourcefolder is the directory with data files
# extension is the extension those files end with
# metadatapath is the path to a metadata csv
# outputpath is the path to a csv of results to be written
# and vocabpath is the path to a file of words to be used
#   as features for all models
#
# exclusions unpacks into
# excludeif, excludeifnot, excludebelow, excludeabove, sizecap
# where
# all the "excludes" are dictionaries pairing a key (the name of a metadata
#     column) with a value that should be excluded -- if it's present,
#     absent, lower than this, or higher than this.
# sizecap limits the number of vols in the positive class; randomly
#      sampled if greater.
#
# classifyconditions unpacks into:
# positive_tags, negative_tags, datetype, numfeatures, regularization, testconditions
# where
# positive_tags is a list of tags to be included in the positive class
# negative_tags is a list of tags to be selected for the negative class
#     (unless volume also has a positive_tag, and note that the negative class
#      is always selected to match the chronological distribution of the positive
#      as closely as possible)
# datetype is the date column to be used for chronological distribution
# numfeatures can be used to limit the features in this model to top N;
#      it is in practice not functional right now because I'm using all
#      features in the vocab file -- originally selected by doc frequency in
#      the whole corpus
# regularization is a constant to be handed to scikit-learn (I'm using one
#    established in previous experiments on a different corpus)
# and testconditions ... is complex.
#
# The variable testconditions will be a set of tags. It may contain tags for classes
# that are to be treated as a test set. Positive volumes will be assigned to
# this set if they have no positive tags that are *not* in testconditions.
# A corresponding group of negative volumes will at the same time
# be assigned. It can also contain two integers to be interpreted as dates, a
# pastthreshold and futurethreshold. Dates outside these thresholds will not
# be used for training. If date thresholds are provided they must be provided
# as a pair to clarify which one is the pastthreshold and which the future.
# If you're only wanting to exclude volumes in the future, provide a past
# threshold like "1."

# All of these conditions exclude volumes from the training set, and place them
# in a set that is used only for testing. But also note that these
# exclusions are always IN ADDITION TO holding-out-authors.

# In other words, if an author w/ multiple volumes has only some of them excluded
# from training by testconditions, it is *still* the case that the author will never
# be in a training set when her own volumes are being predicted.

    This has become the central workhorse class in the module. It takes

    Then it runs a grid search, modeling the texts using a range of parameters
    defined by modelparams. This involves trying different numbers of features
    while simultaneously varying C. Logistic regression and SVMs are both
    supported as options; the constant C has a different meaning in those two
    algorithms, but the process of tuning parameters is basically analogous.

    After finding the best number of features, and value of C, we run the
    model again using those parameters, to get predicted probabilities
    for volumes. Technically, I suppose we could have saved all
    the predictions from the grid search to avoid this step, but omg, needless
    complexity.

    a list of coefficients and a model object that can be saved to be applied
