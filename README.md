overlapping categories
======================

Python 3 code for training models in a multilabel environment where categories overlap. Right now the scripts use regularized logistic regression, but that's immaterial; the hard part, responsible for all the lines of code, is managing metadata. This code probably needs to be refactored to make better use of pandas; that could make it much simpler and more readable.

This first commit contains the original versions from the /fiction repo. They were subsequently changed.
