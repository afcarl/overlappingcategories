# logisticpredict.py
#
# Based on logisticleave1out.py which was based on
# parallel_crossvalidate.py from the paceofchange repo.
#
# Reads all volumes meeting a given set of criteria,
# and uses a leave-one-out strategy to distinguish
# reviewed volumes (class 1) from random
# (class 0). In cases where an author occurs more
# than once in the dataset, it leaves out all
# volumes by that author whenever making a prediction
# about one of them.
#
# This version differs from parallel_crossvalidate
# in using a different metadata structure, and
# especially a multi-tag folksonomic system for
# identifying the positive and negative classes.
# In other words, volumes aren't explicitly divided
# into positive and negative classes in the metadata;
# they can carry any number of tags; you decide, when
# you run the model, which tags you want to group as
# positive and negative classes. The code will ensure
# that no volumes with a positive tag are present in
# the negative class, and also ensure that the two
# groups have roughly similar distributions across
# the timeline.
#
# The main class here is create_model().
# It accepts three parameters, each of which is a tuple
# that gets unpacked.
#
# There are unfortunately a lot of details in those tuples,
# because I've written this script to be very flexible and
# permit a lot of different kinds of modeling.
#
# paths unpacks into
# sourcefolder, extension, metadatapath, outputpath, vocabpath
# where
# sourcefolder is the directory with data files
# extension is the extension those files end with
# metadatapath is the path to a metadata csv
# outputpath is the path to a csv of results to be written
# and vocabpath is the path to a file of words to be used
#   as features for all models
#
# exclusions unpacks into
# excludeif, excludeifnot, excludebelow, excludeabove, sizecap
# where
# all the "excludes" are dictionaries pairing a key (the name of a metadata
#     column) with a value that should be excluded -- if it's present,
#     absent, lower than this, or higher than this.
# sizecap limits the number of vols in the positive class; randomly
#      sampled if greater.
#
# classifyconditions unpacks into:
# positive_tags, negative_tags, datetype, numfeatures, regularization, testconditions
# where
# positive_tags is a list of tags to be included in the positive class
# negative_tags is a list of tags to be selected for the negative class
#     (unless volume also has a positive_tag, and note that the negative class
#      is always selected to match the chronological distribution of the positive
#      as closely as possible)
# datetype is the date column to be used for chronological distribution
# numfeatures can be used to limit the features in this model to top N;
#      it is in practice not functional right now because I'm using all
#      features in the vocab file -- originally selected by doc frequency in
#      the whole corpus
# regularization is a constant to be handed to scikit-learn (I'm using one
#    established in previous experiments on a different corpus)
# and testconditions ... is complex.
#
# The variable testconditions will be a set of tags. It may contain tags for classes
# that are to be treated as a test set. Positive volumes will be assigned to
# this set if they have no positive tags that are *not* in testconditions.
# A corresponding group of negative volumes will at the same time
# be assigned. It can also contain two integers to be interpreted as dates, a
# pastthreshold and futurethreshold. Dates outside these thresholds will not
# be used for training. If date thresholds are provided they must be provided
# as a pair to clarify which one is the pastthreshold and which the future.
# If you're only wanting to exclude volumes in the future, provide a past
# threshold like "1."

# All of these conditions exclude volumes from the training set, and place them
# in a set that is used only for testing. But also note that these
# exclusions are always IN ADDITION TO leave-one-out crossvalidation by author.

# In other words, if an author w/ multiple volumes has only some of them excluded
# from training by testconditions, it is *still* the case that the author will never
# be in a training set when her own volumes are being predicted.
